# BBC Kiswahili Data Scraper

This repo contains python code that scrapes data from the BBC Kiswahili website and saves the 
data to a text file. The scraped data can then be imported into a csv file for further analysis.

## Requirements
To run the scraper yourself, you'll need the following 

python 3.6 or higher
beautifulsoup4 (4.12.2)
requests library (2.31.0)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
``` git clone https://github.com/brucemug/bbc-kiswahili-data-scraper.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```cd bbc-kiswahili-data-scraper```

3. To run the scraper, run the following command in your terminal

On running for the first time, the scraper will create text files in the data folder. The text files will contain the scraped data.
